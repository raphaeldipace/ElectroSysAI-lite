# ElectroSysAI ⚡🧠  
**Intelligent Electrical System Analyzer with Phasor and 3D Visualization**

This project provides an advanced toolkit for analyzing power systems — including single-phase, three-phase, transformers, and transmission lines — with rich visualizations, AI suggestions (optional), and a modular architecture.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔌 **System Types Supported**:
  - Single-phase systems
  - Three-phase systems (w/ angle + voltage selection)
  - Transformers (w/ turns ratio modeling)
  - Transmission Lines (per-phase impedance, complex analysis)

- 📊 **Visualizations**:
  - Phasor diagrams (fasorial analysis)
  - Voltage/Current curves per phase
  - 3D surface: Power vs Voltage vs Current

- 🧠 **Optional AI Suggestions**:
  - Uses OpenAI GPT to suggest improvements in parameter robustness

- 🖼️ **Clean and styled plots** (white background, fine lines, labeled)

## 💻 Recommended Usage

It is **highly recommended** to use this project with:

- **✅ Jupyter Notebook** (locally via Anaconda or VSCode)
- **✅ Google Colab** (fully supported, GPU optional)

You will get the best interactivity and graphical outputs this way.
